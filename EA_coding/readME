How to run :

javac Players.java 
java Players 

Concept :
1. I first create a map for each player. 
and each player will have it's own map which consits of gameName and time stamp 
2. For each player i sorted the map of gameName, timestamp by timestamp 
3. Now, for each sorted map, i create all possible combination of game, timestamp where we satisfy t1<t2<t3 etc 

and then store the final output on a file 




Test Case : 
Tom	    game1	4
Mike	game1	3
Tom	    game2	1
Tom	    game3	3
Mike	game3	2
Tom	    game4	2
Mike	game4	1

Output of my program :

tripletMap {123=2, 234=1}
which is basically same as 

(game4, game3, game1)           2
(game2, game4, game3)           1
